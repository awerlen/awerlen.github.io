I am a PhD Student in astrophysics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Munich Center for Geoastronomy.

My research focuses on the interactions between planetary interiors and atmospheres, aiming to understand their composition and evolution. In particular, I study how interiorâ€“atmosphere exchange governs planetary habitability and shapes the diversity of planetary environments beyond the Solar System.

I completed my MSc in Physics at ETH Zurich, where I investigated global chemical equilibrium in sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, analysing how hydrogen-rich envelopes interact with deep magma oceans. I also hold a BSc in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Bern.
