I am a physicist with an MSc in Physics from ETH Zürich, currently working in the Exoplanet Interiors Group led by Prof. Caroline Dorn at ETH Zürich.

My research combines thermodynamics and numerical modelling to study how volatile species partition between a planet’s interior and its atmosphere. These interactions govern the chemical evolution of planets during their magma-ocean stages and provide the foundation for distinguishing abiotic chemical fingerprints from those that could arise from life.
