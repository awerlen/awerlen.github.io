I am a Doctoral Researcher in astrophysics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

My research broadly explores the link between planetary interiors and atmospheres, with a focus on how volatile elements move between silicate, metal, and gas reservoirs.  

I hold an MSc in Physics from ETH Zurich and a BSc in Physics and Astronomy from the *University of Bern*. 

During my Masterâ€™s studies, I worked extensively on global chemical equilibrium models for sub-Neptune and super-Earth exoplanets, investigating how their hydrogen-rich envelopes interact with deep magma oceans.  

At present, my research centers on outgassing models for terrestrial planets, aiming to connect interior composition, magma ocean processes, and atmospheric evolution.  
This work is motivated by the broader question of planetary habitability and the emergence of diverse planetary environments beyond our Solar System.
